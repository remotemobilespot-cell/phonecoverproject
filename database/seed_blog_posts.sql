    'A great custom phone case starts with a great photo. Whether you''re capturing memories, artwork, or creating original designs, the quality of your image directly impacts the final result.

## Understanding Resolution and Print Quality

For the best results, your image should be at least 300 DPI at the final print size. This ensures crisp, clear details that won''t appear pixelated.

## Lighting is Everything

Natural lighting is your best friend. Golden hour provides warm, flattering light, while overcast days offer even, diffused lighting perfect for detailed shots.

## Composition Techniques

Use the rule of thirds to create visually appealing layouts. Consider how your design will look wrapped around your phone - important elements should be positioned thoughtfully.

## Color Considerations

Remember that colors may appear differently when printed. Bright, saturated colors typically translate well to phone cases.',
