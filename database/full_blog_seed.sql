    '# How to Take the Perfect Photo for Your Custom Phone Case

A great custom phone case starts with a great photo. Whether you''re capturing memories, artwork, or creating original designs, the quality of your image directly impacts the final result.

## Understanding Resolution and Print Quality

For the best results, your image should be at least 300 DPI at the final print size. This ensures crisp, clear details that won''t appear pixelated on your finished case.

## Lighting is Everything

Natural lighting is your best friend when taking photos for printing:

- **Golden Hour**: Provides warm, flattering light perfect for portraits
- **Overcast Days**: Offer even, diffused lighting ideal for detailed shots
- **Avoid Harsh Shadows**: They can create unwanted contrast in your prints

## Composition Techniques

Use the rule of thirds to create visually appealing layouts. Consider how your design will look wrapped around your phone - important elements should be positioned thoughtfully.

## Color Considerations

Remember that colors may appear differently when printed. Bright, saturated colors typically translate well to phone cases, while very dark or very light areas might lose detail.',

    '# 5 Ways Custom Cases Protect Your Phone Investment

Your smartphone represents a significant investment - often $800-$1200 or more. A quality custom case doesn''t just look great; it provides essential protection that can save you hundreds in repair costs.

## 1. Drop Protection That Really Works
Our cases are engineered to absorb impact from drops up to 6 feet. The multi-layer design distributes force across the entire case, protecting your phone''s delicate internal components.

## 2. Screen and Camera Protection
Raised bezels around the screen and camera prevent direct contact with surfaces when your phone is placed face-down, significantly reducing the risk of scratches and cracks.

## 3. Water and Splash Resistance
While not fully waterproof, our cases provide excellent splash protection for everyday situations like rain, spilled drinks, or kitchen accidents.',
